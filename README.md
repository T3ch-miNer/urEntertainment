Content Based Recommender System recommends movies similar to the movie user likes

The data of the movies is fetched using API by [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_2020) .

## How to get the API key?

Create an account in https://www.themoviedb.org/, click on the `API` link from the left hand sidebar in your account settings and fill all the details to apply for API key. If you are asked for the website URL, just give "NA" if you don't have one. You will see the API key in your `API` sidebar once your request is approved.

run `pip install tmdbv3api`
